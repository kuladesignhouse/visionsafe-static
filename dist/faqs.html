              <p>EVAS is an acronym for the “Emergency Vision Assurance System.” EVAS provides a clear path through which a pilot can see flight instruments and out the front windscreen regardless of the smoke density.  This allows the pilot to safely land the plane if there is smoke in the cockpit.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
              <h2>Is EVAS FAA approved? </h2>
              <p>Yes, EVAS is FAA approved. <br>VisionSafe is the only PMA (Parts Manufacturer Approval) manufacturing facility in Hawaii. Our product is the ONLY FAA Certified Cockpit Smoke Displacement System. By retrofitting EVAS, it helps aircraft meet the enhanced standards for continuous cockpit smoke protection recommended by the FAA in Advisory Circular 25.9A. <br><b>Note:</b> Not only is EVAS approved by the FAA, but is installed on all turbine aircraft
    excluding turboprop.</p>

              <h2>What is the purpose of EVAS? </h2>
              <p>EVAS is a fully self-contained unit which ensures a pilot’s continuous vision despite the density of smoke within the cockpit. The unit draws in smoke, filters it to a 0.3 micron and fills a customized IVU (Inflatable Vision Unit) with clear air. This safety feature allows the pilot to see his instruments, out the front windscreen and safely land the aircraft in a smoke emergency.</p>

              <h2>How does a country outside the United States get an STC approval from their government?</h2>
              <p>It varies by country. We would need to follow the same process as we do in the U.S.  We would go through the FAA and put in a request. We presently have certifications with the United States (FAA), Canada (TCCA), Europe (EASA), China (CAAC), Argentina (ANAC), Brazil (ANAC), Hong Kong (HKCAD), Mexico (DGAC), and Turkey, (DGCA).

              <h2>Why is EVAS essential to an aircraft?</h2>
              <p>Smoke emergencies are a serious on-going problem and continue to rise at an alarming rate. In 2017 – there were 1,650 reported smoke incidents. In 2018 – According to the latest data (received 10/14/2019) there were 1,722 reported smoke incidents. In 2019 – there were 653 smoke incidents reported (as per the FAA more information to follow pending verifications). On average, there are about 3 incidences of smoke or fumes on an aircraft in the United States alone. This striking statistic had the FAA send out an InFO report addressing the seriousness of the matter. Smoke, fire and fumes in the cockpit represents one of the most feared hazards within aviation. It can lead to loss of control of the aircraft which leads to loss of lives. EVAS provides that sense of security. We provide the crew and passengers an added safety measure, the necessary tool to see clearly in a dense smoke-filled cockpit so the pilot may safely land the aircraft.</p>

            <div class="faq-item">
              <h2>What is the difference between a Smoke Hood and an EVAS safety system?</h2>
              <p><b>The Advantages vs. Disadvantages of a Smoke Hood & EVAS</b><br>Smoke hoods are for breathing and not for seeing through dense smoke.
    The most basic function of the smoke hood is to protect pilots/victims from fire and the effects of smoke inhalation. They would mainly be used when a crew member is not seated in a crew position.  Its’ purpose is to provide a “portable” smoke 
    and oxygen mask situation in which the pilot must leave the flight deck.
    However, it is important to note that while a pilot may use a smoke hood, it does not take the place of an EVAS safety system.
    A pilot would still need EVAS in order to see their flight instruments and see clearly through the windscreen. Once the EVAS unit is deployed, the IVU allows the pilot to safely land the aircraft in the event of a smoke emergency. 
    Remember, if a pilot can’t see, he can’t fly.
    Therefore, in conclusion, a smoke hood is not a substitute for an EVAS safety system, or vice versa.

              <h2>Here are the necessary steps to properly deploy an EVAS system during an actual smoke emergency in the cockpit:</h2>
              <p><b>Note:</b> Refer to Training Document 8015 for complete instructions.<br>The pilot will deploy the unit by first removing the cover from the EVAS container.<br>
    Once the container is open, the pilot inserts his hand into the unit and removes the IVU from the container and places the entire IVU package onto a strip of loop fastener installed on the glare shield.<br>
    Removal of the IVU package from the container pulls a lanyard, closing the lanyard switch, will automatically start the blower and switch the internal IVU light ON (LED LIGHT).<br>
    As soon as vision assistance is needed during a smoke emergency, the pilot must hold the IVU in place on the glare shield with one hand and release the IVU for inflation by firmly pulling on the tab of the restraining strap with the other hand.<br>
    As the IVU begins to inflate, the pilot may assist the inflation process by gently unfolding the IVU envelope. The pilot will then position the windshield portion and the instrument panel portion for optimum vision. It’s important to assist the instrument portion of the IVU so it inflates between the control wheel and the instruments.<br>
    While the unit is in use, EVAS will inflate the IVU with filtered, clear air at a pressure slightly above that of ambient air, thus displacing all the smoke of the IVU. Being that the IVU is transparent, this gives the pilot a clear view to the essential flight instruments and the windshield. There is a small LED light that is fixed within the IVU which remains lit to provide the necessary illumination of the flight instruments.

              <p>We are aware of 2 fully deployed EVAS systems on an aircraft and several occurrences of EVAS being “armed” in flight.                                     
    It is a requirement under FAR §91.1415 to report smoke events to the Administrator.
    Commercial aircraft are required to submit incident reports as per the
    FAA requirements.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
              <h2>Can the unit be deployed solely for training purposes before the product gets shipped to Hawaii for service?</h2>
              <p>We offer our customers specially designed training materials to assist them in arming, deploying and cost-effective reuse of the EVAS safety system.
    We also recommend training to our customers on how to properly place 
    and deploy the unit, followed by actual flying situations with full deployment.
    Then, once a customer purchases an EVAS unit, technically it is up to their discretion on whether they choose to deploy the unit for their own training purposes. 
    Remember the <u><b>IVU</b></u> is typically for <u><b>1 time use only</b></u> and would need to be replaced.
    Keep in mind, VisionSafe <u><i>will charge</i></u> a customer for servicing a unit that has been deployed other than for an actual smoke emergency. A customer may be charged anywhere from $3,000 to $6,000 for servicing the unit.<br>

            <div class="faq-item">
              <h2>How long does the IVU take to inflate?</h2>
              <p>The range in time relays primarily to the size to the cockpit. A smaller aircraft will
    require less time (approx. 30 seconds) for a smaller IVU whereas a larger aircraft will require a larger IVU and take more time to inflate (approx. 60 seconds). The range 
    in time allows the pilot to provide adjustments as deemed necessary as it inflates.</p>

              <h2>Once EVAS is deployed, is there a way the customer can conserve the battery life if the aircraft is overwater?</h2>
              <p>Yes, the EVAS unit has a master switch, whereas the pilot can continuously turn the power on and off. The pilot will notice the IVU will begin to deflate and will need to turn it back on if the smoke increases within the cockpit. In doing so, the pilot will be able to extend the life of battery as opposed to it running continuously.
    However, keep in mind that the duration of running the unit non-stop 
    for approximately 2.5 in flight should provide ample time to locate an area for a safe landing.</p>

              <h2>How long can a unit run long haul over water prior to reaching a safe landing?</h2>
              <p>Approximately 2.5 hours non-stop (150 minutes).
    Given 2 units, with one being operable and the other on standby, (deployed but not inflated). The aircraft could have approximately 4.5 hours of minimum of flight time. This also will be dependent on the size of the IVU in the aircraft.</p>

              <h2>Is EVAS more efficient at higher altitudes?</h2>
              <p>EVAS is an open system that is not affected by pressure in a stored state. 
    In a deployed state, a 12VDC blower provides positive filtered air pressure to inflate the IVU.  An attached relief valve is used to normalize the pressure in the IVU and prevent back pressure to the blower.
    Internal IVU pressure is approximately <u>9.6 in H20</u> which is <u>measured in manometer</u>. In theory, EVAS becomes more efficient at higher altitudes due to the internal cabin pressure acting on EVAS at cruising is max at 8000 ft <u>(≈ 10.9 psia)</u> whereas at sea level it's approximately <u>14.7 psia.</u></p>

    A test time is performed on the fire-retardant nylon. It is a 12 second vertical burn 
    test that is a FAA requirement. 
    The components that makeup the <u><i>EVAS system have passed all 14 CFR 25.853 flammability requirements.</i></u></p>

    to able to see all the essential instruments for flight which include 
    airspeed, altimeter, vertical speed, heading and turn coordinators.

              <p>No, it would not. Once the IVU is deployed, it will not interfere with the Electronic
    Flight Information System, (EFIS). During the certification process, the EVAS unit
    is tested to ensure that upon deployment, it will not cause any interference
    or uncommand inputs.
    Most touch screens require something conductive to activate them.  The materials 
    are not conductive and do not activate touchscreens on their own.  
    Therefore, if you were to apply pressure on the IVU itself, it would not activate
    an iPad. However, if you would use your finger to touch the material and the screen, it would then activate a touch screen.  But, not on its’ own.</p>

     EVAS?</h2>
              <p>For the simple fact, EVAS can save your life.
    Aviation safety is important in all respects because when it comes to aviation, there is no second chance.
    It is our mission at VisionSafe to provide pilots with one of the most important tools in the aviation industry, the ability to see clearly during a smoke emergency in 
    the cockpit.
    Safety is our #1 priority.
    This is like an aircraft being equipped with personal floatation devices and life rafts, although the actual incident may be low, but when needed, it can save lives.
    No one can predict when a cockpit smoke emergency can happen, but when it
    does, crews and passengers should feel rest assured that every possibly life-saving resource has been provided to them.
    In 2019 – there were 653 smoke incidents reported 
    (as per the FAA – more information to follow pending verifications).</p>

             <p>Most organizations do not endorse specific products, they will instead support a given technology.  Some of the largest pilot unions including ALPA, CAPA, and organizations like the Royal Aeronautical Society, Flight Safety Foundation and others, have all voiced support for “Smoke Displacement Technology” of which EVAS is the only system.  Furthermore the FAA has equipped their own aircraft with EVAS, and the CAST Safety Enhancement SE 226 document calls for Air Carriers to  “Implement a means to maintain pilots’ view of necessary flight information in dense continuous smoke conditions on the flight deck. <a href="https://www.visionsafe.com/docs/Cast_SE226.pdf">Download the CAST Safety Enhancement SE 226</a></p>

              <h2>We have smoke evacuation ports on our aircraft, why do we need EVAS?</h2>
              <p>The 747 Smoke Port was not developed as a solution for blinding smoke in the cockpit, in fact the port was originally a sexton star sighting port! Crew members would open the port to take star shots for navigation. It was later repurposed as a suction vent. The Royal Aeronautical Societies SAFITA report (Smoke And Fumes In Transport Aircraft) points out this suction vent, and the suction vent created by an open window pull air and smoke from within the aircraft to the cockpit and then attempt to vent it over board. This concept is terminally flawed. As Boeing and ALPA reports conclude - a overwhelming majority of  smoke events are generated from a source that cannot be determined in flight and that cannot be extinguished in flight. This fact means that the majority of smoke events should be deemed as capable of generating continuous smoke. The FAA states this factually and clearly in part 25.9a documentation. Thus an event of smoke that reaches a point when vision is obscured in the flight deck is not likely to improve or be contained - smoke will continue to be generated by the source - whatever that may be.<br>For this reason cockpit venting has an extremely narrow scope of benefit. VisionSafe and Singapore Airlines conducted a best case test to determine the effectiveness of the 747 smoke port during an event of continuously generated smoke from a source within the cockpit. The port had no effect on visibility - the smoke port's ability to vent smoke and dilute remaining smoke had no effect on cockpit visibility.  The port was open - the aircraft was fully pressurized and - nothing other than noise related to the suction occurred. The smoke remained. Only in cases when the source of smoke has been stopped will cockpit venting procedures be effective.<br>Venting on its own is an effective method of air exchange. The concept of dumping smoke over board and refilling the aircraft with clean air offers momentary relief. Unchecked smoke sources however have now been aggravated by the "blow torch" effect of massive airflow exchange, and once the pressure vessel has fully vented the ability to pressure vent is over. A reinvigorated continuous smoke source will now refill the aircraft with smoke quickly. Now a crew left with cockpit suction venting using smoke ports or windows has really reached the end of the line. Suction venting will draw smoke into the flight deck, and if the source is the flight deck and is continuous as we've seen in the Singapore Airlines test -  it will not work. Bleed air and Ram air provide a degree of smoke dilution - but one must consider the smoke from a fire involving aircraft materials is a thick black dense smoke, it will not always work in a meaningful manner. This is a serious condition.<br>EVAS Smoke Protection is the only solution. Crews can forget about the smoke and save the aircraft. In an aircraft that is salvageable - nothing is more fundamentally critical than vision. No landing gear, no engines, no brakes, no hydraulics, critically damaged flight controls - all of this and more is trained for and survivable - but two blind pilots are incapacitated, and may as well have jump out of the aircraft. And the flight that could have made it is lost - for no good reason.<br>An event when the smoke source is arrested is counter intuitive to the use of EVAS, once this has been achieved EVAS's function has been completed. However - the very critical factor must be considered. All events where smoke is present are in fact fire or dispersed vapor emergencies. The flight crews attention must not be diverted from the task of landing as soon as practical, and to secure and stop the source of smoke and fire. The reality is that once the smoke levels reach a point of interfering with pilot vision - the entire focus of the crew becomes dealing with a smoke emergency - at this point the source continues un-checked, and the process of landing the aircraft becomes impossible.<br>EVAS equipped aircraft are not subjected to the distraction of a smoke emergency. Flight crews are afforded life saving options - they can continue on to a safe landing, and continue to run procedures aimed at securing the source of the smoke. The best chance for survival is provided by the EVAS system.</p>
