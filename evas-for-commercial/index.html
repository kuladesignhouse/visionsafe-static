      <h2>EVAS is certified for well over 100 aircraft types</h2>
      <p class="p-ccc">EVAS is certified for most Boeing, Airbus and ETOPS aircraft flying today. The system requires virtually no installation. EVAS only takes the space of one Jeppesen Manual. When needed, the pilot removes the IVU (Inflatable Vision Unit) from the EVAS case and pulls a tab to activate the system. The IVU inflates with one lobe above and one below the glareshield. The whole process only takes around 30 seconds.</p>

    <p class="p-li-ion">One of the largest trends in the growth of in-flight fire is due to the transportation of lithium batteries. Grey market batteries and chargers are a high risk. The demand for lithium batteries continues to rise. They are in virtually every electronic device. Lithium batteries are part of modern life, so we as an industry have no choice but to mitigate it because we are not going to eliminate this threat.</p>

      <h3>Under the Risk Control section of this document, paragraph 11.2.6 reads:</h3>
      <p>11.2.6 In the event that the other controls and mitigations listed above have not been effective, the crew may experience smoke in the flight deck that reduces visibility (protective breathing equipment is already required     <b>but does not necessarily provide visibility). There are means to displace smoke physically in order to make the flight critical instruments and electronic systems visible in the event of significant loss of visibility in the flight deck. To be most effective, a manufacturer should align any vision augmentation system</b> with the capability and duration of the protective breathing system.</p>

      <h1>Consideration for EVAS for PAX Operators</h1>
      <h2>The Emergency Vision Assurance System, EVAS, represents a significant and demonstrable enhancement in air safety.  Smoke in airliner cockpits is a known occurrence, and one that has been a factor in a number of fatal air accidents. EVAS allows pilots to see cockpit instruments and through the windshield in the event of blinding smoke. Today, over 4,500 aircraft have EVAS.</h2>
      <ul class="custom-list">
        <li>The very fact that air carriers have face masks or integrated smoke goggles makes clear that they understand and recognize the risk of smoke in the cockpit.</li>
        <li>Former NTSB Chairman Jim Hall, who oversaw the agency during two fatal smoke-in-cockpit accidents, says installation of systems to see through cockpit smoke should be required. The need for such systems has “always been a no-brainer,” Hall says. “The nearest fire exit doesn’t work well at 30,000 feet.”</li>
        <li>An EVAS® shipset costs less than an average tank of fuel, for one cross-country flight.</li>
        <li>The absence of EVAS® is the absence of a system that addresses a known potential safety issue – continuous smoke that impairs pilot vision.</li>
        <li>EVAS® is a Category “D” deferred maintenance item (DMI) in most of our operators MEL.  Which means it will never ground a flight if inoperable.</li>
        <li>The FAAs reference to Safety Enhancement 226, Advisory Circular 120, and its own InFO report highlight the dangers of smoke in the cockpit, and the value that a Smoke Displacement system like EVAS® offers during a smoke emergency.</li>
        <li>A Proven, In-Use Solution. The EVAS® system has been approved by the Federal Aviation Administration and is now in use at numerous air carriers, most cargo operators, and on FAA aircraft.</li>
        <li>In Advisory Circular 25.9a, the FAA recommends that aircraft meet higher standards for continuous cockpit smoke protection. Those standards are delivered by EVAS®.</li>
        <li>The added safety of the EVAS® system represents not only increased protection for passengers, crew, and cargo, but, on a secondary basis, adds a higher protection of the value of the airline’s key assets, which range from the value of the aircraft to the brand identity of the airline.</li>
        <li>Major airlines and Part 135 operators have adopted the EVAS® system, which validates the efficacy of the system, and the fact that it is a compatible and cost-effective addition to the cockpit of the modern airliner.</li>
