Clearing Views, Saving Lives. VisionSafe was founded by Bertil Werjefelt, inventor of numerous aviation safety devices. After his invention of PBE (Portable Breathing Equipment) or the smoke hood which is now found worldwide from the halls of congress to virtually all commercial aircraft, Bertil turned his attention to solving a problem that had plagued aviation for decades - blinding smoke in the cockpit. Bertil an avid pilot, with a reputation for coming up with ingenious solutions to longstanding problems, had been approached by leading aviation safety experts notifying him of the alarming rate of smoke incidences and drawing his attention to catastrophic accidents. Bert quickly embarked on his plan to solve the problem, and the solution was EVAS. Decades later VisionSafe Corporation and the EVAS product is the leader in smoke displacement technology. EVAS has certifications for well over 100 aircraft types, and is found on Corporate, Commercial, Government, Cargo and Military aircraft the world over, as do over 70% of fortune 100 companies and even FAA VIP aircraft.

XTO Energy Yona Aviation Certifications In May of 2016, NSF-ISR assessed the Quality management system of VisionSafe Corporation, manufacturer of the Emergency Vision Assurance System (EVAS®) and determined that the company’s Quality system is in compliance with ISO 9001:2015, AS9100 Rev D and AS9110 Rev C requirements. ISO 9001 is a quality management system (QMS) standard that requires an organization to meet its own requirements and those of its customers and regulators. It is based on the plan-do-check-act methodology, which helps organizations establish, implement, monitor and measure their processes to deliver results that align with the organization’s requirements and continually improve performance by taking appropriate action. AS9100 is the quality management system (QMS) standard specific to the aerospace industry. Efforts of the aerospace industry to establish a single common Quality Management System resulted in AS9100, AS9110, AS9120. The AS9110 standard is complimentary to AS9100 and is based on the ISO 9001 quality management system. The AS9110 certification elevates the quality management system to the globally recognized standard. AS9110 takes a process-based approach by focusing on and identifying the key processes and achieving on-going improvements within those processes. The scope of VisionSafe’s registrations include design, manufacture, assembly, service, and repair of the Emergency Vision Assurance System for the commercial, private, and military industries.

An average of 560+ lithium batteries per flight. Due to smoke or fumes on the aircraft in the US alone. EVAS is certified on over 120 aircraft types. Progress in safety is coming... Today while cargo operators the world over are equipping their fleets with EVAS, passenger fleets are still behind the curve in equipping their aircraft. Despite the rising concern of smoke and fire on aircraft due to Lithium batteries and their increasing presence aboard commercial flights, the fact is that a higher percentage of cargo aircraft are protected today than are the planes that fly millions of people around the globe annually... a staggering fact that can be changed. Emergency Vision Assurance System An overview of the Emergency Vision Assurance System Capt. Depete - VP of ALPA shares his testimonial about EVAS EVAS is certified for well over 100 aircraft types EVAS is certified for most Boeing, Airbus and ETOPS aircraft flying today. The system requires virtually no installation. EVAS only takes the space of one Jeppesen Manual. When needed, the pilot removes the IVU (Inflatable Vision Unit) from the EVAS case and pulls a tab to activate the system. The IVU inflates with one lobe above and one below the glareshield. The whole process only takes around 30 seconds. <!-- Vision assurance technology should be implemented to improve pilot visibility during continuous smoke in the flight deck. Royal Aeronautical Society ...the Secretary of Transportation, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and FAA have equipped their aircraft with technology to permit their pilots to see in a cockpit filled with continuous unstoppable smoke, the public and airline crews deserve the same degree of safety. Royal Aeronautical Society ALPA is very concerned that aircraft cockpits must be able to evacuate smoke effectively, so the crew can safely land the aircraft. --> Inflight Fires due to Lithium Batteries One of the largest trends in the growth of in-flight fire is due to the transportation of lithium batteries. Grey market batteries and chargers are a high risk. The demand for lithium batteries continues to rise. They are in virtually every electronic device. Lithium batteries are part of modern life, so we as an industry have no choice but to mitigate it because we are not going to eliminate this threat. Inflight fires due to lithium-ion batteries has doubled every years since 2014. A 2016 FAA report found that on average every 10 days a lithium-ion battery fire occors on a flight in the US alone. An estimated 500+ lithium batteries are carried on commercial flights. Government Adoption FAA flies with EVAS The FAA flies with EVAS on their aircraft, as do many government and executive aircraft around the world, a clear testament to the caliber of approval EVAS has as a serious safety enhancement. World Wide Adoption From The U.S to Europe, the Mid East and Asia, governments around the world have equipped their countries planes with EVAS. Union Support Both CAPA and ALPA, some of the largest pilot unions in the world, have supported smoke displacement as a viable and valuable method to safeguard pilots from blinding smoke in the cockpit.

Cargo Operators the world over know the dangers involved with blinding smoke in the cockpit, which has led to over 70% of the worlds air cargo operators becoming EVAS equipped. Within the last 10 years there have been countless incidences of smoke in the cockpit This includes a 747 cargo aircraft which became engulfed by smoke originating from a lithium battery fire in its cargo hold. The pilot was unable to even see the dial on the radio to get the right frequency and heading. Despite the aircraft being flyable, the pilot missed the opportunity to land the aircraft and overshot the airport and came within several hundred yards of hitting civilian apartments. Since then the operator of that aircraft equipped its entire fleet with EVAS, shortly thereafter its competitor did the same, followed by many other cargo operators. VisionSafe corporation came up with a solution - EVAS. After numerous incidences of smoke impeding pilots vision, and with catastrophic loss as a result, VisionSafe corporation came up with the solution. EVAS is the worlds only smoke displacement system, which allows a pilot to see their controls even in a smoke filled aircraft. Due to smoke or fumes on aircraft. Over 70% of Worlds Cargo Aircraft are equipped with EVAS. Over 7000 EVAS systems protecting airplanes worldwide. Pilot Unions requested the US congress to mandate that the FAA eliminate the present unsafe conditions associated with blinding smoke in the cockpit. Both the Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA) and the Coalition of Air Line Pilots Association (CAPA) whose combined memberships represent more than 100,000 pilots and over 50 airlines, endorsed the use of cockpit smoke displacement systems (CSDS) as \"standard\" equipment for all airlines. Smoke from oil leaking into hot-air ducts “Oil from the APU (Auxiliary Power Unit) was leaking into the air conditioning hot-air ducts, which resulted in a great deal of smoke in the cockpit. The smoke began coming in through the air vents and filling the cabin and cockpit to the point where I couldn’t see anything, including the flight instruments. At nighttime with an overhead light turned on, it created a beam of light which did nothing more than illuminate the smoke in the cockpit. This is like turning your high beams on and driving in fog. You can’t see anything, except what’s close to you. We donned our smoke goggles which protected our eyes against the smoke, but we still were unable to see anything. I had to lean so far forward in an attempt to see the flight instruments that I was pushing on the yoke. I was leaning in such a very awkward position simply to see the flight instruments..” Burning air conditioning recirculation fan “Another emergency I had was a burning air conditioning recirculation fan. It was burning up and shorting out, and the fumes were so noxious they were burning our eyes, and our throats. We needed to shut down all our electric equipment to try to figure out what was causing this, so we shut everything off, including our weather radar, which we were using to circumnavigate thunderstorms. That was a bit hair raising.” Cockpit suddenly fills with blinding smoke “The cockpit filled with smoke, it wasn’t insidious, it happened all of a sudden, real quickly, and we didn’t know what caused that one, but we had the same issue--I couldn’t see my flight instruments. I had to put on my mask and goggles, and the oxygen mask hose caught on something. I couldn’t lean forward, and couldn’t figure out what it was caught on. I couldn’t see anything anyway, so here I am trying to get closer to my flight instruments, and I couldn’t. I couldn’t see the panel, so I’m feeling around the cockpit by hand where the auto pilot controls are, Until we get this smoke issue resolved, we can’t see anything in the cockpit or what to do.” Cockpit suddenly fills with blinding smoke “The cockpit filled with smoke, it wasn’t insidious, it happened all of a sudden, real quickly, and we didn’t know what caused that one, but we had the same issue--I couldn’t see my flight instruments.

Smoke is the leading defined cause of emergency landings for ETOPS The Emergency Vision Assurance System (EVAS) has been widely adopted by those who fly on private jets. EVAS is available for the majority of medium to long range aircraft types as either standard equipment or on the options lists. If safety is a priority EVAS is a necessity After numerous incidences of smoke impeding pilots vision, and with catastrophic loss as a result, VisionSafe corporation came up with the solution. Bombardier, Dassault Falcon Jet, and Gulfstream Aerospace have designated EVAS as standard client option for their prestigious line of jet aircraft. Well over 2000 ETOPS aircraft are EVAS equipped. Certified for use on 10 OEMs and over 120 Aircraft Type. EVAS is equipped on over 1000 Gulfstream Aircraft. Gulfstream Supplier of the Year After thorough evaluation and review Gulfstream awarded VisionSafe as supplier of the year. Gulfstream has also designated EVAS as a standard equipment on the G650 and as standard client option for the rest of their prestigious line of aircraft. Smoke from oil leaking into hot-air ducts “Oil from the APU (Auxiliary Power Unit) was leaking into the air conditioning hot-air ducts, which resulted in a great deal of smoke in the cockpit. The smoke began coming in through the air vents and filling the cabin and cockpit to the point where I couldn’t see anything, including the flight instruments. At nighttime with an overhead light turned on, it created a beam of light which did nothing more than illuminate the smoke in the cockpit. This is like turning your high beams on and driving in fog. You can’t see anything, except what’s close to you. We donned our smoke goggles which protected our eyes against the smoke, but we still were unable to see anything. I had to lean so far forward in an attempt to see the flight instruments that I was pushing on the yoke.

It was burning up and shorting out, and the fumes were so noxious they were burning our eyes, and our throats.

EVAS is an acronym for the “Emergency Vision Assurance System.” EVAS provides a clear path through which a pilot can see flight instruments and out the front windscreen regardless of the smoke density. This allows the pilot to safely land the plane if there is smoke in the cockpit. Is EVAS FAA approved? Yes, EVAS is FAA approved. VisionSafe is the only PMA (Parts Manufacturer Approval) manufacturing facility in Hawaii. Our product is the ONLY FAA Certified Cockpit Smoke Displacement System. By retrofitting EVAS, it helps aircraft meet the enhanced standards for continuous cockpit smoke protection recommended by the FAA in Advisory Circular 25.9A. Note: Not only is EVAS approved by the FAA, but is installed on all turbine aircraft excluding turboprop. What is the purpose of EVAS? EVAS is a fully self-contained unit which ensures a pilot’s continuous vision despite the density of smoke within the cockpit. The unit draws in smoke, filters it to a 0.3 micron and fills a customized IVU (Inflatable Vision Unit) with clear air. This safety feature allows the pilot to see his instruments, out the front windscreen and safely land the aircraft in a smoke emergency. Does VisionSafe have an STC (Supplemental Type Certificate) for the product? Yes, we do. How does a country outside the United States get an STC approval from their government? It varies by country. We would need to follow the same process as we do in the U.S. We would go through the FAA and put in a request. We presently have certifications with the United States (FAA), Canada (TCCA), Europe (EASA), China (CAAC), Argentina (ANAC), Brazil (ANAC), Hong Kong (HKCAD), Mexico (DGAC), and Turkey, (DGCA). Currently, we are also working with Russia (Rosaviatsiya) to obtain STC approval as well. Why is EVAS essential to an aircraft? Smoke emergencies are a serious on-going problem and continue to rise at an alarming rate. In 2017 – there were 1,650 reported smoke incidents. In 2018 – According to the latest data (received 10/14/2019) there were 1,722 reported smoke incidents. In 2019 – there were 653 smoke incidents reported (as per the FAA more information to follow pending verifications). On average, there are about 3 incidences of smoke or fumes on an aircraft in the United States alone. This striking statistic had the FAA send out an InFO report addressing the seriousness of the matter. Smoke, fire and fumes in the cockpit represents one of the most feared hazards within aviation. It can lead to loss of control of the aircraft which leads to loss of lives. EVAS provides that sense of security. We provide the crew and passengers an added safety measure, the necessary tool to see clearly in a dense smoke-filled cockpit so the pilot may safely land the aircraft. Where is EVAS manufactured? EVAS is proudly made in the USA, Hawaii. EVAS Specifications Is EVAS included on the Minimum Equipment List (MEL)*? Yes, we are. Once EVAS is STC certified, EVAS is added to the MMEL (the master minimum equipment list) by the FAA. The FAA MMEL process can take months as the FAA only addresses MMEL items from time to time. Our product, EVAS, is NOT required for dispatch. Any aircraft that we have an STC for should have the MEL revised and EVAS added. How much does a unit weigh? The unit weighs approximately 6 pounds and is easily installed. What is the make of the EVAS container? The EVAS system is self-contained in a six-sided black anodized aluminum container that is equivalent to the size of a Jeppesen manual. What are the dimensions of an EVAS unit? The unit is lightweight and compact. Measurements are as follows: 10 inches in Height 8.5 inches in Width 3.0 inches in Depth Is EVAS powered by lithium batteries? No, it is independent from the power of the aircraft. It relies on a self-contained battery power supply, blower and filter in each storage case. It is powered by an Alkaline Battery Pack (+/- 12.0V, 3V, 2.8Ah) How long does the battery life last on a unit? The battery pack is certified for up to 27 months with normal testing requirements. VisionSafe Corporation is presently working on the 36-month project. Does the battery need to be charged regularly if it has not been in use? The battery does not need to be charged because it’s an Alkaline Battery. Can a customer change the battery and/or service the unit themselves? No, the customer would need to send the unit back for service. The unit will require to be sent for service if there is a 90-day test failure or if it's due for a biennial service (two year). Can the EVAS battery signal interfere or influence any other instruments/equipment on the aircraft? No, it would not. EVAS is a self-contained and powered unit. This is also part of our certification process to ensure that battery signal would not interfere with any of the equipment on the aircraft. Does each EVAS unit have its’ own serial number? Yes, each EVAS unit has its’ own serial number and each model has its’ own part number. What are the IVU materials made from? The IVU (Inflatable Vision Unit) is made of a flame-retardant rip-stop nylon & Teflon. The thread that is used is a high tensile strength polyester. What is the amount of pressure within the IVU? The internal IVU air pressure is approximately 9.6 in H20. Smoke Hood vs. EVAS What is the difference between a Smoke Hood and an EVAS safety system? The Advantages vs. Disadvantages of a Smoke Hood & EVASSmoke hoods are for breathing and not for seeing through dense smoke. The most basic function of the smoke hood is to protect pilots/victims from fire and the effects of smoke inhalation. They would mainly be used when a crew member is not seated in a crew position. Its’ purpose is to provide a “portable” smoke and oxygen mask situation in which the pilot must leave the flight deck. However, it is important to note that while a pilot may use a smoke hood, it does not take the place of an EVAS safety system. A pilot would still need EVAS in order to see their flight instruments and see clearly through the windscreen. Once the EVAS unit is deployed, the IVU allows the pilot to safely land the aircraft in the event of a smoke emergency. Remember, if a pilot can’t see, he can’t fly. Therefore, in conclusion, a smoke hood is not a substitute for an EVAS safety system, or vice versa. Shipment Once a customer signs a purchase agreement, what is the delivery schedule? f we have an STC for the aircraft, the lead time is 4 to 6 weeks. If we don’t have an STC for the aircraft, then we must go through the certification process with the FAA. The process can take anywhere from 6 to 18 months upon completion. It depends on the complexity of the installation as well as the FAA approval process. If the product arrives damaged, how quickly can it be replaced? If the product arrives damaged, through no fault of the customer, then the turnaround time would be approximately 5 business days. For our fleet customers, we offer a spare and loaner program to ensure that all their aircraft are equipped accordingly if that should happen. For shipping purposes, is EVAS considered hazardous material? EVAS is not considered hazardous. There is a specified label that is placed on the package prior to shipment indicating it does not contain hazardous materials. (Not restricted, SPEC. PROV. A123) If a customer needs to send the unit out for service, what are the shipping requirements? The customer must securely package the EVAS unit. In order to fully secure the unit, it is imperative that the unit is properly cushioned within the package to prevent excessive movement. Proper packing procedures prevents unintentional activation. Each package must be marked clearly “Not Restricted.” The Installation Process Can the customer install the unit themselves and do we provide written instructions for the installation process? Yes, any authorized person (Civil Aviation Authority or FAA) can install an EVAS unit. Customers receive an STC Kit containing written instructions along with the necessary hardware for proper installation. A typical installation may take only 2 hours but a more complicated installation on an aircraft may take up to 8 hours (greater than 2 (model specific) per install). If the unit is installed by a customer, do they receive a special certificate for insurance purposes? No, they do not. However, it is an important component in the operators overall safety culture, Safety Management System (SMS). Does EVAS need to be installed according to the STC location? Every EVAS unit needs to be mounted as per the installation drawings per aircraft that we supply to the customer. Installs generally may take up to 90 minutes per side depending on the EVAS model. What are the basic types of installations for an EVAS system? Direct Mount - the unit would be mounted directly to the airplane structure or instrument console using two or more fasteners. Rail Mount - a mounting rail is attached to the airplane structure or instrument console allowing for ease of installation and removal. The EVAS unit slides into the mounting rail and is secured into place with top mounted fasteners. Where would the unit be installed on the aircraft? Inboard, outboard, or behind of the pilot seat & co-pilot seat. Generally, a unit is installed outboard of the seat. Some installs are inboard or behind. 90% of the installs are outboard of the pilots. Do we offer on-site service? No, there are no field servicing requirements for EVAS. The battery pack cannot be replaced by the customer. EVAS Training Do we offer training to our customers and is there a fee involved? VisionSafe offers several types of training to our customers. Prices may vary per training sessions. Only Private Operators receive a complimentary Key Code from King Schools for training. (1 Key Code (password) is given per new ship set). This does not apply to OEMs, MROs, Airliners and Freighters (UPS/DHL) unless otherwise instructed as most have their own training curriculums. We offer these specific operators a “train the trainer” course for their internal training curriculums. What types of training does VisionSafe offer? King Schools - Online Training FlightSafety International - Simulator Training CAE - Simulator Training How long is the training process? The training process may be completed between 15 minutes to an hour depending on the type of training that is selected, by the operator, designee or owner. How quickly can a customer receive training once they decide to move forward in acquiring EVAS on their aircraft? Online training can be done in advance. If a customer decides to elect another form of training, scheduling time is usually easily available. Routine EVAS Product Testing Is the unit easily accessible for a quick inspection? No, it is not. It is not recommended that a customer tries to Open an EVAS unit for visual inspection as it would lead to an additional non-standard service fee of approximately $3000. However, the unit is readily accessible in the cockpit to perform the required 90-day periodic routine inspection to ensure proper working order. Does EVAS need to be tested periodically to avoid failure, and can anyone run the check points? EVAS operators are required to perform routine inspections every 90 days to ensure that the units are in proper working order. The owner, operator or designee will perform a visual check on the unit for its’ general condition, security and position in the cockpit. The EVAS unit must also be given a blower and battery check to ensure proper battery voltage and blower motor operation. NOTE: The span between checks should not exceed 90 days. EVAS SAFETY SYSTEM TEST GUIDELINES FOR CUSTOMERS EVAS – Position & Location Check Points These checkpoints are performed by the aircraft owner, operator or designee.To be performed 1x a month or at regular intervals not exceeding 90 days. Visual Check A SINGLE EVAS Test Tool is included in each STC kit. A visual check is performed for its’ general condition, security and proper position within the cockpit. Red indicates the left pilot side position. Green indicates the right co-pilot side position. The Blower & Battery Check Depress the blower and battery test buttons simultaneously, insert the tool that comes with the STC Kit (this handy tool is stored inside the label on the top of each EVAS unit). Insert the tool into the “Blower” test hole and into the “Battery” test hole at the same time. Push to test for approximately 1-3 seconds. If the blower motor is heard and a green indicator light appears, then its’ serviceable.In the event the blower motor does not run, EVAS is inoperable. Contact VisionSafe Quality Department at (800-441-9230 or 808-235-0849) or via email at qcontrol@visionsafe.com For the battery, confirm which test lights illuminates. A GREEN “Battery Condition” light- GOOD A YELLOW light appears - the unit must be removed and replaced within 10 calendar days. A RED light (Inop) or NO Light appears – indicates an unacceptable battery. NOTE: In this case, the unit must be removed from the aircraft immediately and make the necessary call for a replacement. Once an EVAS Unit is removed from an aircraft for either a Yellow or Red/No Test Light, it must be returned to VisionSafe immediately for proper inspection. The Loop Fastener Verification The loop fastener(s) are secured on the glare shield. Re-attachment or replacement may be done by using an epoxy adhesive. Specific instructions for each model can be found on the installation drawings. Maintenance Does EVAS require routine maintenance? An EVAS system will require regular service, every 24 months. The service due date is clearly indicated on each EVAS unit. What does 24-month service entail? The EVAS unit will be disassembled, cleaned, inspected, repaired as necessary, reassembled, and tested in accordance with the approved or accepted data. This service includes replacing the battery pack. The service may also include applicable upgrades as deemed necessary by VisionSafe Corporation. EVAS customers must remove their units from the aircraft and ship them to VisionSafe for servicing. Once they are serviced, the engraved year is covered by a new sticker indicating the next service due date. The 2-year service may be performed 3 months prior and up to 3 months after the Service Due Date that is printed on the EVAS container. NOTE: Regardless of when service is done, the next service date will be due 24 months after the original service due date. If the unit is in for service prior to the 3 months or after the 3-month grace period, the base service date will be changed accordingly to reflect the new 24-month due date. NOTE: EVAS units may be subject to additional service fees if it is received more than 3 months past the base service date. When an EVAS safety system needs maintenance, will a customer receive a temporary loaner? Yes, EVAS loaners may be requested by the customer, dependent on the loaner model availability. Loaners will be provided to the customer free of charge. When does the unit require immediate inspection/maintenance? Immediate inspection is required once:An EVAS unit is deployed - this includes and not limited to unintentional, accidental or during an actual smoke emergency (once the IVU is inflated). The integrity of the EVAS container or contents are compromised. For instance, if the unit gets dented somehow, any liquid is accidentally spilled on the unit and leaks into the housing of the unit. Any test in which the “Battery Condition” status indicates “Inop” (Red test light or No light). Once the unit goes in for maintenance, how long is the turnaround time for a replacement? Typically, once an EVAS unit goes in for a repair the service time is typically 24 hours at the facility. The turnaround time is 5 business days. This is dependent on the customer whether they chose FedEx, UPS or DHL as it is at their own expense. New EVAS units get shipped via FedEx to the customer. How quickly can a customer have the EVAS unit re-installed following maintenance? Once the initial install is done on the aircraft, the re-install following routine maintenance would take a minimal amount of time. Does the unit require a rebuild after being on an aircraft for a long period of time? A 120 month (10 yr.) rebuild is performed on an EVAS unit. The 120 months rebuild includes replacing most major parts to the unit. Once a customer signs a contract to obtain an EVAS Safety System, VisionSafe offers their customers a 50% discount from the original purchase price towards an EVAS replacement. Purchase vs. Lease Agreement Can a customer lease an EVAS unit? Yes, we do offer leasing programs to our customers and are available upon request. However, it is important to note that it is customer specific, based on their need and the agreement. Insurance Do insurance companies recognize EVAS as a safety feature and offer a discount to their customers? Yes, they do to a degree, it’s more of an “enhancement” to the insurance companies review of an airlines Safety Management System (SMS). Although, there is no direct correlation, it is part of an overall safety assessment grade. PROPER DEPLOYMENT PROCEDURES FOR EVAS SAFETY SYSTEM Here are the necessary steps to properly deploy an EVAS system during an actual smoke emergency in the cockpit: Note: Refer to Training Document 8015 for complete instructions.The pilot will deploy the unit by first removing the cover from the EVAS container. Once the container is open, the pilot inserts his hand into the unit and removes the IVU from the container and places the entire IVU package onto a strip of loop fastener installed on the glare shield. Removal of the IVU package from the container pulls a lanyard, closing the lanyard switch, will automatically start the blower and switch the internal IVU light ON (LED LIGHT). As soon as vision assistance is needed during a smoke emergency, the pilot must hold the IVU in place on the glare shield with one hand and release the IVU for inflation by firmly pulling on the tab of the restraining strap with the other hand. As the IVU begins to inflate, the pilot may assist the inflation process by gently unfolding the IVU envelope. The pilot will then position the windshield portion and the instrument panel portion for optimum vision. It’s important to assist the instrument portion of the IVU so it inflates between the control wheel and the instruments. While the unit is in use, EVAS will inflate the IVU with filtered, clear air at a pressure slightly above that of ambient air, thus displacing all the smoke of the IVU. Being that the IVU is transparent, this gives the pilot a clear view to the essential flight instruments and the windshield. There is a small LED light that is fixed within the IVU which remains lit to provide the necessary illumination of the flight instruments. EVAS DEPLOYMENT Has there been a history of EVAS deployments with previous aircraft? We are aware of 2 fully deployed EVAS systems on an aircraft and several occurrences of EVAS being “armed” in flight. It is a requirement under FAR §91.1415 to report smoke events to the Administrator. Commercial aircraft are required to submit incident reports as per the FAA requirements. Can the unit be deployed solely for training purposes before the product gets shipped to Hawaii for service? We offer our customers specially designed training materials to assist them in arming, deploying and cost-effective reuse of the EVAS safety system. We also recommend training to our customers on how to properly place and deploy the unit, followed by actual flying situations with full deployment. Then, once a customer purchases an EVAS unit, technically it is up to their discretion on whether they choose to deploy the unit for their own training purposes. Remember the IVU is typically for 1 time use only and would need to be replaced. Keep in mind, VisionSafe will charge a customer for servicing a unit that has been deployed other than for an actual smoke emergency. A customer may be charged anywhere from $3,000 to $6,000 for servicing the unit. Remember – EVAS is for Emergency Use Only. Can EVAS be easily and quickly deployed? Yes, it can be easily and quickly deployed. It takes about 30 to 60 seconds for the IVU to fully inflate. How long does the IVU take to inflate? The range in time relays primarily to the size to the cockpit. A smaller aircraft will require less time (approx. 30 seconds) for a smaller IVU whereas a larger aircraft will require a larger IVU and take more time to inflate (approx. 60 seconds). The range in time allows the pilot to provide adjustments as deemed necessary as it inflates. Has the company ever considered a quicker method of inflating the IVU? Given the need for self-powering the unit and our avoidance to lithium ion batteries, the current system we provide to inflate the IVU is the most reliable and safest method. In the event of a smoke emergency and the unit is deployed, what happens next? f an EVAS unit is deployed in an actual smoke emergency, it is imperative that a PILOT SMOKE EVENT REPORT* is filled out. This form may be completed either by the pilot or another crew member familiar with the incident. All information that is provided will be kept CONFIDENTIAL and PROPRIETARY. Once the form is filled out, a customer has the following options available to them: Mail VisionSafe Corporation Quality Assurance46-217 Kahuhipa StreetKaneohe, HI 96744 Fax 808-247-6313 Email qcontrol@visionsafe.com In an Emergency, If EVAS is deployed in an actual smoke emergency, please contact VisionSafe’s Quality Assurance Department at (800) 441-9230. How long will it stay inflated? The maximum operating time is approximately 4 hours. Rated operating time is 2.5 hours. Does EVAS maintain its’ functionality and shape during depressurization? EVAS has been altitude tested to 50,000 feet with a depressurization within 15 seconds, followed by additional fluctuations in altitude, during these tests EVAS conformed to its’ performance specs. What if the unit malfunctions during deployment in a smoke emergency? There have been no reported incidences of unit malfunctions due to: VisionSafe ensures that each EVAS System is tested prior to shipment. The customer also performs the functional test (blower & battery check) every 90 days. The system will then require a Biennial Service (every 2 years) in which the unit will be disassembled, cleaned, inspected, repaired as necessary, reassembled, and tested in accordance with the approved or accepted data. At VisionSafe, our team’s primarily goal in Quality is to prevent that from happening. Once EVAS is deployed, is there a way the customer can conserve the battery life if the aircraft is overwater? Yes, the EVAS unit has a master switch, whereas the pilot can continuously turn the power on and off. The pilot will notice the IVU will begin to deflate and will need to turn it back on if the smoke increases within the cockpit. In doing so, the pilot will be able to extend the life of battery as opposed to it running continuously. However, keep in mind that the duration of running the unit non-stop for approximately 2.5 in flight should provide ample time to locate an area for a safe landing. How long can a unit run long haul over water prior to reaching a safe landing? Approximately 2.5 hours non-stop (150 minutes). Given 2 units, with one being operable and the other on standby, (deployed but not inflated). The aircraft could have approximately 4.5 hours of minimum of flight time. This also will be dependent on the size of the IVU in the aircraft. Once EVAS is deployed, does it affect the internal cabin pressure in an aircraft? No, it will not. Is EVAS more efficient at higher altitudes? EVAS is an open system that is not affected by pressure in a stored state. In a deployed state, a 12VDC blower provides positive filtered air pressure to inflate the IVU. An attached relief valve is used to normalize the pressure in the IVU and prevent back pressure to the blower. Internal IVU pressure is approximately 9.6 in H20 which is measured in manometer. In theory, EVAS becomes more efficient at higher altitudes due to the internal cabin pressure acting on EVAS at cruising is max at 8000 ft (≈ 10.9 psia) whereas at sea level it's approximately 14.7 psia. Upon deployment, can the IVU burn while in use during a smoke emergency? The IVU is made from a clear Teflon and a ripstop fire-retardant nylon, that is sewn together using a high tensile strength polyester thread. A test time is performed on the fire-retardant nylon. It is a 12 second vertical burn test that is a FAA requirement. The components that makeup the EVAS system have passed all 14 CFR 25.853 flammability requirements. If the IVU get punctured or burns a slight hole, what happens next? The IVU will still maintain in its’ shape and form despite a small puncture. The view is enough to see out the window and the instruments. This is all part of the STC approval process. However, the EVAS unit must be sent in for repair. Flight Path What is the approximate view of flight for the crew, once EVAS is deployed? If the unit is deployed in an actual smoke emergency, the IVU provides a flight path view up to 53º wide, depending on cockpit geometry and size. What specific instruments will the pilot be able to see during a smoke emergency in the cockpit? When the unit was initially designed, the goal was for the flight crew to able to see all the essential instruments for flight which include airspeed, altimeter, vertical speed, heading and turn coordinators. The pilot will be able to easily access the emergency check lists, approach plates (airspeed & altimeter), iPad and electronic flight bag (EFB) as each unit has pockets for convenience. If EVAS is deployed in a smoke emergency, can it accidentally interfere/touch/activate any of the pilot’s controls? No, it would not. Once the IVU is deployed, it will not interfere with the Electronic Flight Information System, (EFIS). During the certification process, the EVAS unit is tested to ensure that upon deployment, it will not cause any interference or uncommand inputs. Most touch screens require something conductive to activate them. The materials are not conductive and do not activate touchscreens on their own. Therefore, if you were to apply pressure on the IVU itself, it would not activate an iPad. However, if you would use your finger to touch the material and the screen, it would then activate a touch screen. But, not on its’ own. Will the pilot and co-pilot be able to breathe comfortably once the EVAS safety system is deployed? The EVAS unit is used in conjunction with the aircraft’s emergency oxygen mask and goggles in order to breathe comfortably once the cockpit is filled with smoke. EVAS Warranty Do we offer a warranty and what does it cover specifically? Yes, EVAS is covered by a comprehensive renewable/transferable 10-year warranty. EVAS sold as loose equipment Can a Part 135 or Part 91 Operator buy EVAS as loose equipment? VisionSafe recommends using the STC version of the EVAS unit. There is no additional fee for the STC version, and the installation itself is very inexpensive. Part 91 operators do not require an STC. However, Part 135 operators do require the STC for the main purpose of acquiring training for the installed equipment. Is a customer able to convert their current EVAS unit? Can the customer purchase only selected parts such as the IVU to meet new requirements of another aircraft? (For Example - from a Falcon to a Gulfstream aircraft) No, EVAS is not serviceable in the field and the components are not interchangeable. What is involved when switching loose equipment to STC certified equipment?(Bracket and back plate upgrade?) We cannot modify loose equipment to STC equipment. Can an EVAS product be customized? And if so, how? No, not typically. If we have an approved EVAS model, we cannot do any customizing. The only time we “customize” is during the design and certification process. Once we have the STC, we cannot change the unit without recertification. Customization is possible if there is a signed purchase agreement between VisionSafe Corporation and the customer. We can provide customer specified colors on the container for cargo fleet customers. VisionSafe: The Company Where is the company headquartered? VisionSafe’s main headquarters is in Kaneohe, Hawaii.

If an aircraft has not experienced a smoke emergency, then why the need for EVAS? For the simple fact, EVAS can save your life. Aviation safety is important in all respects because when it comes to aviation, there is no second chance. It is our mission at VisionSafe to provide pilots with one of the most important tools in the aviation industry, the ability to see clearly during a smoke emergency in the cockpit. Safety is our #1 priority. This is like an aircraft being equipped with personal floatation devices and life rafts, although the actual incident may be low, but when needed, it can save lives. No one can predict when a cockpit smoke emergency can happen, but when it does, crews and passengers should feel rest assured that every possibly life-saving resource has been provided to them. In 2019 – there were 653 smoke incidents reported (as per the FAA – more information to follow pending verifications). What organizations support the use of EVAS? Most organizations do not endorse specific products, they will instead support a given technology. Some of the largest pilot unions including ALPA, CAPA, and organizations like the Royal Aeronautical Society, Flight Safety Foundation and others, have all voiced support for “Smoke Displacement Technology” of which EVAS is the only system. Furthermore the FAA has equipped their own aircraft with EVAS, and the CAST Safety Enhancement SE 226 document calls for Air Carriers to “Implement a means to maintain pilots’ view of necessary flight information in dense continuous smoke conditions on the flight deck. Download the CAST Safety Enhancement SE 226 We have smoke evacuation ports on our aircraft, why do we need EVAS? The 747 Smoke Port was not developed as a solution for blinding smoke in the cockpit, in fact the port was originally a sexton star sighting port! Crew members would open the port to take star shots for navigation. It was later repurposed as a suction vent. The Royal Aeronautical Societies SAFITA report (Smoke And Fumes In Transport Aircraft) points out this suction vent, and the suction vent created by an open window pull air and smoke from within the aircraft to the cockpit and then attempt to vent it over board. This concept is terminally flawed. As Boeing and ALPA reports conclude - a overwhelming majority of smoke events are generated from a source that cannot be determined in flight and that cannot be extinguished in flight. This fact means that the majority of smoke events should be deemed as capable of generating continuous smoke. The FAA states this factually and clearly in part 25.9a documentation. Thus an event of smoke that reaches a point when vision is obscured in the flight deck is not likely to improve or be contained - smoke will continue to be generated by the source - whatever that may be.For this reason cockpit venting has an extremely narrow scope of benefit. VisionSafe and Singapore Airlines conducted a best case test to determine the effectiveness of the 747 smoke port during an event of continuously generated smoke from a source within the cockpit. The port had no effect on visibility - the smoke port's ability to vent smoke and dilute remaining smoke had no effect on cockpit visibility. The port was open - the aircraft was fully pressurized and - nothing other than noise related to the suction occurred. The smoke remained. Only in cases when the source of smoke has been stopped will cockpit venting procedures be effective.Venting on its own is an effective method of air exchange. The concept of dumping smoke over board and refilling the aircraft with clean air offers momentary relief. Unchecked smoke sources however have now been aggravated by the \"blow torch\" effect of massive airflow exchange, and once the pressure vessel has fully vented the ability to pressure vent is over. A reinvigorated continuous smoke source will now refill the aircraft with smoke quickly. Now a crew left with cockpit suction venting using smoke ports or windows has really reached the end of the line. Suction venting will draw smoke into the flight deck, and if the source is the flight deck and is continuous as we've seen in the Singapore Airlines test - it will not work. Bleed air and Ram air provide a degree of smoke dilution - but one must consider the smoke from a fire involving aircraft materials is a thick black dense smoke, it will not always work in a meaningful manner. This is a serious condition.EVAS Smoke Protection is the only solution. Crews can forget about the smoke and save the aircraft. In an aircraft that is salvageable - nothing is more fundamentally critical than vision. No landing gear, no engines, no brakes, no hydraulics, critically damaged flight controls - all of this and more is trained for and survivable - but two blind pilots are incapacitated, and may as well have jump out of the aircraft. And the flight that could have made it is lost - for no good reason.An event when the smoke source is arrested is counter intuitive to the use of EVAS, once this has been achieved EVAS's function has been completed. However - the very critical factor must be considered. All events where smoke is present are in fact fire or dispersed vapor emergencies. The flight crews attention must not be diverted from the task of landing as soon as practical, and to secure and stop the source of smoke and fire. The reality is that once the smoke levels reach a point of interfering with pilot vision - the entire focus of the crew becomes dealing with a smoke emergency - at this point the source continues un-checked, and the process of landing the aircraft becomes impossible.EVAS equipped aircraft are not subjected to the distraction of a smoke emergency. Flight crews are afforded life saving options - they can continue on to a safe landing, and continue to run procedures aimed at securing the source of the smoke. The best chance for survival is provided by the EVAS system.

Emergency Vision Assurance System (EVAS) provides a clear space of air through which a pilot can see flight instruments and out the front windshield for landing the plane in the event of in cockpit smoke. When smoke evacuation procedures are not sufficient, EVAS®&nbsp;provides emergency backup allowing the pilot to see and fly the aircraft to a safe landing. Statistics from FAA Service Difficulty Reports clearly show that in-flight fires, smoke or fumes are some of the most significant causes of unscheduled or emergency landings and account for on average one precautionary landing per day.

EVAS®&nbsp;in detail A pilot encountering smoke in the cockpit so thick that the instruments cannot be seen can utilize a relatively simple device, which provides a clear view. Emergency Vision Assurance System (EVAS®) provides a clear space of air through which a pilot can see flight instruments and out the front windshield for landing. The pilot still relies on the oxygen mask for breathing, smoke goggles for eye protection and employs approved procedures for clearing smoke from the aircraft. EVAS measures 3 x 8.5 x 10 inches when stowed, the approximate space of a Jeppessen navigation manual. When needed, the pilot removes the IVU (Inflatable Vision Unit) from the EVAS®&nbsp;case and pulls a tab to activate the system. The IVU inflates with one lobe above and one below the glareshield. According to VisionSafe Corporation, the distributor of EVAS®, the whole process takes 15-20 seconds. The pilot leans forward, placing his smoke goggles in contact with the EVAS®&nbsp;clear window, giving him an unimpaired view of both vital instruments and the outside world. The device is independent of aircraft power, relying on a self-contained battery-power supply, pump and filters in each storage case. EVAS®&nbsp;systems are designed to run for at least two hours, and filter down to .01 microns. The system requires virtually no installation. While the FAA regulations require smoke detectors, fire extinguishers, smoke goggles and oxygen masks, pilots point out that these safeguards and all other systems and equipment for flight safety are useless if the pilots cannot see to control and land the aircraft. VisionSafe Corporation uses a fleet of mobile cockpit demonstration units to show potential customers the benefits of the system. EVAS®&nbsp;demonstrations use a fog generator to reduce cockpit vision so the pilot cannot see his hand in front of his face. Smoke goggles offer no vision improvement, though they do protect the eyes. After EVAS®&nbsp;is deployed, the pilot can clearly see both the vital instruments and out through the windshield. It is truly an amazing experience.

Smoke from oil leaking into hot-air ducts “Oil from the APU (Auxiliary Power Unit) was leaking into the air conditioning hot-air ducts, which resulted in a great deal of smoke in the cockpit. The smoke began coming in through the air vents and filling the cabin and cockpit to the point where I couldn’t see anything, including the flight instruments. At nighttime with an overhead light turned on, it created a beam of light which did nothing more than illuminate the smoke in the cockpit. This is like turning your high beams on and driving in fog. You can’t see anything, except what’s close to you. We donned our smoke goggles which protected our eyes against the smoke, but we still were unable to see anything. I had to lean so far forward in an attempt to see the flight instruments that I was pushing on the yoke. I was leaning in such a very awkward position simply to see the flight instruments..” Burning air conditioning recirculation fan “Another emergency I had was a burning air conditioning recirculation fan. It was burning up and shorting out, and the fumes were so noxious they were burning our eyes, and our throats. We needed to shut down all our electric equipment to try to figure out what was causing this, so we shut everything off, including our weather radar, which we were using to circumnavigate thunderstorms. That was a bit hair raising.” Cockpit suddenly fills with blinding smoke “The cockpit filled with smoke, it wasn’t insidious, it happened all of a sudden, real quickly, and we didn’t know what caused that one, but we had the same issue--I couldn’t see my flight instruments. I had to put on my mask and goggles, and the oxygen mask hose caught on something. I couldn’t lean forward, and couldn’t figure out what it was caught on. I couldn’t see anything anyway, so here I am trying to get closer to my flight instruments, and I couldn’t. I couldn’t see the panel, so I’m feeling around the cockpit by hand where the auto pilot controls are, Until we get this smoke issue resolved, we can’t see anything in the cockpit or what to do.” Cockpit suddenly fills with blinding smoke “The cockpit filled with smoke, it wasn’t insidious, it happened all of a sudden, real quickly, and we didn’t know what caused that one, but we had the same issue--I couldn’t see my flight instruments.

With EVAS®, pilots are able to see the flight path and vital instruments as well as read approach plates and emergency procedures. The ability to perform these functions in an environment of continuous smoke will make a critical difference to safety. In scores of simulator tests with EVAS®, pilots have landed safely with smoke in the cockpit so thick they could not see their hand in front of their face. Current aircraft design and certification criteria rely on smoke evacuation methods. The test procedures for these methods measure the smoke clearing capacity against a \"standard condition.\" That standard condition as defined in FAA Advisory Circular 25-9A states \"to clear the cockpit of smoke after the pilot's view is obscured, without any further smoke being generated.\" What if the source of the smoke has not been isolated? Further, what if the evacuation system can't keep up with the smoke being generated? The answer to these questions is EVAS®. It is the best way to ensure that the flight crew can maintain vision and safely control and land the aircraft when dense smoke in the cockpit cannot be stopped.

Cargo is protected, yet the vast majority of passengers on commercial aircraft are not. 86% of domestic Cargo aircraft are now EVAS equipped, thousands of corporate operators, executive, and VIP aircraft have also chosen to implement EVAS to protect against the hazards of smoke on the flight deck, yet only one major U.S domestic passenger airline has protected itself from blinding smoke in the cockpit. The vast majority of the flying public and most commercial passenger airlines still fly entirely unprotected if smoke becomes blinding to a pilot. The threat is not just to those flying on passenger aircraft, the passengers and crew, an incident in 2012 in Dubai resulted in a 747 just barely missing an apartment complex as the pilot was left completely blinded by smoke before the plane crashed. The result of that incident became the impetus of over 72% of the world's cargo aircraft, and over 86% of U.S domestic cargo aircraft choosing to become EVAS equipped. Organization, Pilot Unions, and Government Agencies Recommend and Most Advocate for a Required Smoke Displacement System. Initiatives such as the CAST Safety Enhancements SE 226 have pushed for implementing “a means to maintain a pilot's view of necessary flight information” while referencing EVAS specifically as a solution to meet this end. Download Full Document Pilot Unions such as CAPA and ALPA, Congressmen, Senators, and more have openly supported the use of Smoke displacement technology to aid in blinding smoke events on aircraft. Download Full Document The FAA released an INFO report indicating that on average over 900 declared emergencies leading to diversions due to smoke or fumes on aircraft happen each year….in the U.S alone. Download Full Document Currently, AC 120-SRACC contains references to smoke displacement and the need to ensure pilots can maintain visibility on the flight deck “to guide airlines in prevention and preparedness in the event of a flight deck smoke emergency.” Under the Risk Control section of this document, paragraph 11.2.6 reads: 11.2.6 In the event that the other controls and mitigations listed above have not been effective, the crew may experience smoke in the flight deck that reduces visibility (protective breathing equipment is already required but does not necessarily provide visibility). There are means to displace smoke physically in order to make the flight critical instruments and electronic systems visible in the event of significant loss of visibility in the flight deck. To be most effective, a manufacturer should align any vision augmentation system with the capability and duration of the protective breathing system.

The Emergency Vision Assurance System (EVAS) provides a clear space of air through which a pilot can see flight instruments and out the front windshield for landing the plane in the event of blinding cockpit smoke. Our mission is to provide the aviation industry with a trusted partner committed to the highest degree of safety in the event of cockpit smoke incidents. Fire extinguishers, goggles and smoke detectors are of no use if the pilot can’t see to control the aircraft. VisionSafe corporation is an ISO 9001 compliant corporation, as well as an FAA and EASA Authorized Repair Station. The EVAS system is FAA approved and certified for well over 100 aircraft type, and is used by thousands of Corporate, Commercial, Government, Cargo and Military aircraft across the world. Over 72% of the worlds cargo aircraft now fly with EVAS, due in large part to the hazards of flying with modern day electronic devices, we are confident that all passenger aircraft will follow suit, and this road will be paved by those pushing aviation safety into the future. certified for well over 100 aircraft type, and is used by thousands of Corporate, Commercial, Government, Cargo and Military aircraft across the world.

Organization, Pilot Unions, and Government Agencies Recommend and Most Advocate for a Required Smoke Displacement System. EVAS is certified on the following type of aircraft: Boeing Airbus Gulfstream Embraer Bombardier Dassault and more OEMs. Full Certification List Pilot Unions such as CAPA and ALPA, Congressmen, Senators, and more have openly supported the use of Smoke displacement technology to aid in blinding smoke events on aircraft. Download Full Document The FAA released an INFO report indicating that on average over 900 declared emergencies leading to diversions due to smoke or fumes on aircraft happen each year….in the U.S alone. Download Full Document Currently, AC 120-SRACC contains references to smoke displacement and the need to ensure pilots can maintain visibility on the flight deck “to guide airlines in prevention and preparedness in the event of a flight deck smoke emergency.” Under the Risk Control section of this document, paragraph 11.2.6 reads: 11.2.6 In the event that the other controls and mitigations listed above have not been effective, the crew may experience smoke in the flight deck that reduces visibility (protective breathing equipment is already required but does not necessarily provide visibility). There are means to displace smoke physically in order to make the flight critical instruments and electronic systems visible in the event of significant loss of visibility in the flight deck. To be most effective, a manufacturer should align any vision augmentation system with the capability and duration of the protective breathing system.

An average of 560+ lithium batteries per flight. Due to smoke or fumes on the aircraft in the US alone. EVAS is certified on over 120 aircraft types. Progress in safety is coming... Today while cargo operators the world over are equipping their fleets with EVAS, passenger fleets are still behind the curve in equipping their aircraft. Despite the rising concern of smoke and fire on aircraft due to Lithium batteries and their increasing presence aboard commercial flights, the fact is that a higher percentage of cargo aircraft are protected today than are the planes that fly millions of people around the globe annually... a staggering fact that can be changed. Emergency Vision Assurance System An overview of the Emergency Vision Assurance System Capt. Depete - VP of ALPA shares his testimonial about EVAS Smoke from oil leaking into hot-air ducts “Oil from the APU (Auxiliary Power Unit) was leaking into the air conditioning hot-air ducts, which resulted in a great deal of smoke in the cockpit. The smoke began coming in through the air vents and filling the cabin and cockpit to the point where I couldn’t see anything, including the flight instruments. At nighttime with an overhead light turned on, it created a beam of light which did nothing more than illuminate the smoke in the cockpit. This is like turning your high beams on and driving in fog. You can’t see anything, except what’s close to you. We donned our smoke goggles which protected our eyes against the smoke, but we still were unable to see anything. I had to lean so far forward in an attempt to see the flight instruments that I was pushing on the yoke. I was leaning in such a very awkward position simply to see the flight instruments..” Burning air conditioning recirculation fan “Another emergency I had was a burning air conditioning recirculation fan. It was burning up and shorting out, and the fumes were so noxious they were burning our eyes, and our throats. We needed to shut down all our electric equipment to try to figure out what was causing this, so we shut everything off, including our weather radar, which we were using to circumnavigate thunderstorms. That was a bit hair raising.” Cockpit suddenly fills with blinding smoke “The cockpit filled with smoke, it wasn’t insidious, it happened all of a sudden, real quickly, and we didn’t know what caused that one, but we had the same issue--I couldn’t see my flight instruments. I had to put on my mask and goggles, and the oxygen mask hose caught on something. I couldn’t lean forward, and couldn’t figure out what it was caught on. I couldn’t see anything anyway, so here I am trying to get closer to my flight instruments, and I couldn’t. I couldn’t see the panel, so I’m feeling around the cockpit by hand where the auto pilot controls are, Until we get this smoke issue resolved, we can’t see anything in the cockpit or what to do.” Cockpit suddenly fills with blinding smoke “The cockpit filled with smoke, it wasn’t insidious, it happened all of a sudden, real quickly, and we didn’t know what caused that one, but we had the same issue--I couldn’t see my flight instruments.

The system requires virtually no installation. EVAS only takes the space of one Jeppesen Manual. When needed, the pilot removes the IVU (Inflatable Vision Unit) from the EVAS case and pulls a tab to activate the system. The IVU inflates with one lobe above and one below the glareshield. The whole process only takes around 30 seconds. <!-- Vision assurance technology should be implemented to improve pilot visibility during continuous smoke in the flight deck. Royal Aeronautical Society ...the Secretary of Transportation, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and FAA have equipped their aircraft with technology to permit their pilots to see in a cockpit filled with continuous unstoppable smoke, the public and airline crews deserve the same degree of safety. Royal Aeronautical Society ALPA is very concerned that aircraft cockpits must be able to evacuate smoke effectively, so the crew can safely land the aircraft. --> Inflight Fires due to Lithium Batteries One of the largest trends in the growth of in-flight fire is due to the transportation of lithium batteries. Grey market batteries and chargers are a high risk. The demand for lithium batteries continues to rise. They are in virtually every electronic device. Lithium batteries are part of modern life, so we as an industry have no choice but to mitigate it because we are not going to eliminate this threat. Inflight fires due to lithium-ion batteries has doubled every years since 2014. A 2016 FAA report found that on average every 10 days a lithium-ion battery fire occors on a flight in the US alone. <!--An estimated 500+ lithium batteries are carried on commercial flights.--> Speak with one of our specialists about adding a crucial layer of safety to your fleet. +1 (800) 441-9230 Government Adoption FAA flies with EVAS The FAA flies with EVAS on their aircraft, as do many government and executive aircraft around the world, a clear testament to the caliber of approval EVAS has as a serious safety enhancement.

Emergency Vision Assurance System (EVAS®) provides a clear space of air through which a pilot can see flight instruments and out the front windshield for landing. The pilot still relies on the oxygen mask for breathing, smoke goggles for eye protection and employs approved procedures for clearing smoke from the aircraft. EVAS measures 3 x 8.5 x 10 inches when stowed, the approximate space of a Jeppessen navigation manual. When needed, the pilot removes the IVU (Inflatable Vision Unit) from the EVAS®&nbsp;case and pulls a tab to activate the system. The IVU inflates with one lobe above and one below the glareshield. According to VisionSafe Corporation, the distributor of EVAS®, the whole process takes 15-20 seconds. The pilot leans forward, placing his smoke goggles in contact with the EVAS®&nbsp;clear window, giving him an unimpaired view of both vital instruments and the outside world. The device is independent of aircraft power, relying on a self-contained battery-power supply, pump and filters in each storage case. EVAS®&nbsp;systems are designed to run for at least two hours, and filter down to .01 microns. The system requires virtually no installation. While the FAA regulations require smoke detectors, fire extinguishers, smoke goggles and oxygen masks, pilots point out that these safeguards and all other systems and equipment for flight safety are useless if the pilots cannot see to control and land the aircraft. VisionSafe Corporation uses a fleet of mobile cockpit demonstration units to show potential customers the benefits of the system. EVAS®&nbsp;demonstrations use a fog generator to reduce cockpit vision so the pilot cannot see his hand in front of his face. Smoke goggles offer no vision improvement, though they do protect the eyes. After EVAS®&nbsp;is deployed, the pilot can clearly see both the vital instruments and out through the windshield. It is truly an amazing experience.

Smoke from oil leaking into hot-air ducts “Oil from the APU (Auxiliary Power Unit) was leaking into the air conditioning hot-air ducts, which resulted in a great deal of smoke in the cockpit. The smoke began coming in through the air vents and filling the cabin and cockpit to the point where I couldn’t see anything, including the flight instruments. At nighttime with an overhead light turned on, it created a beam of light which did nothing more than illuminate the smoke in the cockpit. This is like turning your high beams on and driving in fog. You can’t see anything, except what’s close to you. We donned our smoke goggles which protected our eyes against the smoke, but we still were unable to see anything. I had to lean so far forward in an attempt to see the flight instruments that I was pushing on the yoke. I was leaning in such a very awkward position simply to see the flight instruments..” Burning air conditioning recirculation fan “Another emergency I had was a burning air conditioning recirculation fan. It was burning up and shorting out, and the fumes were so noxious they were burning our eyes, and our throats. We needed to shut down all our electric equipment to try to figure out what was causing this, so we shut everything off, including our weather radar, which we were using to circumnavigate thunderstorms. That was a bit hair raising.” Cockpit suddenly fills with blinding smoke “The cockpit filled with smoke, it wasn’t insidious, it happened all of a sudden, real quickly, and we didn’t know what caused that one, but we had the same issue--I couldn’t see my flight instruments. I had to put on my mask and goggles, and the oxygen mask hose caught on something. I couldn’t lean forward, and couldn’t figure out what it was caught on. I couldn’t see anything anyway, so here I am trying to get closer to my flight instruments, and I couldn’t. I couldn’t see the panel, so I’m feeling around the cockpit by hand where the auto pilot controls are, Until we get this smoke issue resolved, we can’t see anything in the cockpit or what to do.” Cockpit suddenly fills with blinding smoke “The cockpit filled with smoke, it wasn’t insidious, it happened all of a sudden, real quickly, and we didn’t know what caused that one, but we had the same issue--I couldn’t see my flight instruments.

The SmokeScope is very simple to use and can be deployed in under 20 seconds. Its patent pending design allows for it to be lightweight, with no power requirement, quickly deployable, it is available as portable equipment for new and existing EVAS customers. Supplement to EVAS The SmokeScope has been developed as a supplement to the EVAS system as a collapsible, lightweight, handheld IVU that can reach fuses, switches, panels and other areas that are beyond the view of the EVAS IVU. EVAS is an STC’d or Portable system that is customized for each aircraft type to be deployed and fixed to the glareshield to allow pilots to see critical flight instrumentation during a blinding smoke event. &lt;20 Sec. SmokeScope can beDeployed in under 20 seconds Dimensions Unfolded ≈ 8.5”x8.5”x18”Folded in pouch ≈ 2”x6”x7” Weight Pouch & SmokeScope ≈ .5lbsSmokeScope ≈ .4lbs Frequently Asked Questions about the SmokeScope Can the SmokeScope be bought on its own? Currently the SmokeScope is not available for individual purchase. It is only available as a supplement to our EVAS 107 system, and should be noted is NOT a replacement to EVAS. The SmokeScope does not allow a pilot to operate hands free, nor does it cover the critical flight instrumentation the way an EVAS does, thus it should ONLY be used as a supplementary piece of equipment to be used alongside an EVAS 107 in case of emergency. Where can I get Instructions for the SmokeScope? Here is a link to instructions on how to use the SmokeScope. We will soon be providing videos as well on how to properly deploy a SmokeScope. Where can I get trained for the SmokeScope? The SmokeScope is very easy to deploy and use. FSI, CAE and other training facilities will soon be offering SmokeScope training alongside EVAS training, until then you can refer to our online SmokeScope training brochure here: Insert link to training brochure. Does the SmokeScope require service? The SmokeScope requires overhaul once every 10 years. What is the warranty for the SmokeScope? The Scope comes with a ten year warranty. Where can I buy the SmokeScope? The SmokeScope can be purchased directly through VisionSafe corporation or its authorized resellers alongside purchase of an EVAS shipset. How frequently do Smoke In the Cockpit events really occur? On average there are 3 unscheduled landings per day to smoke or fumes on aircraft, see our smoke Incident list here for some of the latest events to hit the news. Can I deploy my SmokeScope and repackage it? No, Smoke Scope deployment training will only be offered at the following training facilities. Should a Smoke Scope be deployed it will need to be sent back to VisionSafeCorporation and a service fee will be applied for assessing and repackaging, or replacing the SmokeScope.

EVAS®&nbsp;View EVAS®&nbsp;protected aircraft can be flown no matter how much smoke gets in the cockpit. Emergency Vision Assurance System (EVAS) provides a clear space of air through which a pilot can see flight instruments and out the front windshield for landing the plane in the event of in cockpit smoke. When smoke evacuation procedures are not sufficient, EVAS®&nbsp;provides emergency backup allowing the pilot to see and fly the aircraft to a safe landing. Statistics from FAA Service Difficulty Reports clearly show that in-flight fires, smoke or fumes are some of the most significant causes of unscheduled or emergency landings and account for on average one precautionary landing per day.

Light Weight and Compact EVAS®&nbsp;measures 3 x 8.5 x 10 inches when stowed, the approximate space of a Jeppessen navigation manual and weighs less than 6lbs (2.7kg) Self Contained Power Supply The device is independent of aircraft power, relying on a self-contained alkaline battery-power supply, pump and filters in each storage case. 10 Year Warranty EVAS is covered by a comprehensive renewable/transferable 10 Year Warranty. Trusted by the best The system requires virtually no installation. EVAS only takes the space of one Jepp Manual case. When needed, the pilot removes the IVU (Inflatable Vision Unit) from the EVAS®&nbsp;case and pulls a tab to activate the system. The IVU inflates with one lobe above and one below the glareshield. The whole process about 30 seconds. Recommended by the FAA and other aviation authorities.

EVAS®&nbsp;in detail A pilot encountering smoke in the cockpit so thick that the instruments cannot be seen can utilize a relatively simple device, which provides a clear view. Emergency Vision Assurance System (EVAS®) provides a clear space of air through which a pilot can see flight instruments and out the front windshield for landing. The pilot still relies on the oxygen mask for breathing, smoke goggles for eye protection and employs approved procedures for clearing smoke from the aircraft. EVAS measures 3 x 8.5 x 10 inches when stowed, the approximate space of a Jeppessen navigation manual. When needed, the pilot removes the IVU (Inflatable Vision Unit) from the EVAS®&nbsp;case and pulls a tab to activate the system. The IVU inflates with one lobe above and one below the glareshield. According to VisionSafe Corporation, the distributor of EVAS®, the whole process takes 15-20 seconds. The pilot leans forward, placing his smoke goggles in contact with the EVAS®&nbsp;clear window, giving him an unimpaired view of both vital instruments and the outside world. The device is independent of aircraft power, relying on a self-contained battery-power supply, pump and filters in each storage case. EVAS®&nbsp;systems are designed to run for at least two hours, and filter down to .01 microns. The system requires virtually no installation. While the FAA regulations require smoke detectors, fire extinguishers, smoke goggles and oxygen masks, pilots point out that these safeguards and all other systems and equipment for flight safety are useless if the pilots cannot see to control and land the aircraft. VisionSafe Corporation uses a fleet of mobile cockpit demonstration units to show potential customers the benefits of the system. EVAS®&nbsp;demonstrations use a fog generator to reduce cockpit vision so the pilot cannot see his hand in front of his face. Smoke goggles offer no vision improvement, though they do protect the eyes. After EVAS®&nbsp;is deployed, the pilot can clearly see both the vital instruments and out through the windshield. It is truly an amazing experience. Product Specs Compact: 3\" x 8.5\" x 10\"(75mm x 215mm x 255mm) Light weight: ~ 5.5Lbs (2.5KG) 15-20 second deployment time Self-contained power supply Easy to install 10 Year Warranty Displaces all smoke in the vision path regardless of density Provides clear vision of basic instruments and flight path Allows for use of emergency checklists, navigation charts, etc Recommended by the FAA and other aviation authorities Why Evas Due to smoke or fumes on the aircraft in the US alone. An average of 560+ lithium batteries per flight. EVAS®&nbsp;is certified on over 120 aircraft types. The EVAS® has one defining purpose: Protect the pilot's vision to ensure a safe landing during a smoke in the cockpit emergency. Smoke from oil leaking into hot-air ducts “Oil from the APU (Auxiliary Power Unit) was leaking into the air conditioning hot-air ducts, which resulted in a great deal of smoke in the cockpit. The smoke began coming in through the air vents and filling the cabin and cockpit to the point where I couldn’t see anything, including the flight instruments. At nighttime with an overhead light turned on, it created a beam of light which did nothing more than illuminate the smoke in the cockpit. This is like turning your high beams on and driving in fog. You can’t see anything, except what’s close to you. We donned our smoke goggles which protected our eyes against the smoke, but we still were unable to see anything. I had to lean so far forward in an attempt to see the flight instruments that I was pushing on the yoke. I was leaning in such a very awkward position simply to see the flight instruments..” Burning air conditioning recirculation fan “Another emergency I had was a burning air conditioning recirculation fan. It was burning up and shorting out, and the fumes were so noxious they were burning our eyes, and our throats. We needed to shut down all our electric equipment to try to figure out what was causing this, so we shut everything off, including our weather radar, which we were using to circumnavigate thunderstorms. That was a bit hair raising.” Cockpit suddenly fills with blinding smoke “The cockpit filled with smoke, it wasn’t insidious, it happened all of a sudden, real quickly, and we didn’t know what caused that one, but we had the same issue--I couldn’t see my flight instruments. I had to put on my mask and goggles, and the oxygen mask hose caught on something. I couldn’t lean forward, and couldn’t figure out what it was caught on. I couldn’t see anything anyway, so here I am trying to get closer to my flight instruments, and I couldn’t. I couldn’t see the panel, so I’m feeling around the cockpit by hand where the auto pilot controls are, Until we get this smoke issue resolved, we can’t see anything in the cockpit or what to do.” Cockpit suddenly fills with blinding smoke “The cockpit filled with smoke, it wasn’t insidious, it happened all of a sudden, real quickly, and we didn’t know what caused that one, but we had the same issue--I couldn’t see my flight instruments.

With EVAS®, pilots are able to see the flight path and vital instruments as well as read approach plates and emergency procedures. The ability to perform these functions in an environment of continuous smoke will make a critical difference to safety. In scores of simulator tests with EVAS®, pilots have landed safely with smoke in the cockpit so thick they could not see their hand in front of their face. Current aircraft design and certification criteria rely on smoke evacuation methods. The test procedures for these methods measure the smoke clearing capacity against a \"standard condition.\" That standard condition as defined in FAA Advisory Circular 25-9A states \"to clear the cockpit of smoke after the pilot's view is obscured, without any further smoke being generated.\" What if the source of the smoke has not been isolated? Further, what if the evacuation system can't keep up with the smoke being generated? The answer to these questions is EVAS®. It is the best way to ensure that the flight crew can maintain vision and safely control and land the aircraft when dense smoke in the cockpit cannot be stopped.

Wait 30 seconds for home screen to appear. Follow on screen instructions to use remote to select the EVAS app on top left of screen. Press play by using the trigger button with your index finger and that’s it! Hello from VisionSafe, manufacturer of the Emergency Vision Assurance System (EVAS)! In the box you will find our current Virtual Reality headset with a pre-programmed 360 video of an EVAS demonstration (NOT a training video). The video loops between a view of EVAS deployed in a smoke filled environment, before showing a pilot deploy EVAS as the cockpit fills with smoke. We at VisionSafe thank you for taking the time to get to know our product! What you are viewing: The video opens with a smoke filled cockpit and a view through EVAS. Then the video shows a deployment of EVAS. The pilot first notices the smoke, then dons his mask. He then deploys EVAS by pulling the unit out from the outboard side, near his left thigh (look down and to the left and you will see this). Then he places the unit on the glare shield and deploys EVAS, before the view changes to a view of EVAS through a smoke filled cockpit. The video loops so feel free to let it run and have others preview. Once finished just place back into the box. Detailed Instructions: To power on the headset, press top center button on headset for 2-3 seconds. The screen will power on with a white oval on the screen. After about 10 seconds the headset will make a sound, then take another 20 seconds before it is ready to use. Once a screen appears with various icons to choose from, pick up the remote control and point it forward and press the Home button (the oval icon) with your thumb. This will center the remote and screen for you. If it doesn’t work on the first push, press the button once more. Point the remote at the EVAS icon the top left of the Home Screen, and use your index finger to push the Trigger button on the remote to select and start the app. That’s it! The EVAS experience will begin and the video will loop on itself until you choose to stop it. Once finished with the demo press the top center button to power down the unit, then select “power off” using the remote, and index finger Trigger button.
